# Agent Development Guide

This document aims to provide some clarification and guidelines to assist miners in development of trading strategies for deployment in the subnet.  This is not intended as a comprehensive set of instructions, but rather provides an overview of the basic understanding and tools needed to begin the design and implementation of agent logic in the context of Ï„aos simulations.

## Data

The first piece of the puzzle is understanding the format and content of the data published by validators.  Each request sent by a validator includes the latest (partial L3 + L2) state of all orderbooks in the simulation, a record of all events occurring in the simulation since the last update, and miner-specific information relating to the state of the agent's accounts and those events which involve the agent's orders.  The protocol class which defines how this data is represented practically can be found [here](/taos/im/protocol/__init__.py); the structure is expanded and documented for convenient reference in [The Appendix](#the-marketsimulationstateupdate-class).

### Processing State Updates

There are two main types of data that may need to be processed by an agent in deciding on their next trading actions: the first is the actual state data communicating the latest state of each of the simulated orderbooks, and the other is the notices which indicate when an event has occurred in relation to one of the agent's orders.

#### Book States

The latest state of the simulated orderbooks is contained in the `state.books` dictionary.  This dictionary maps the integer identifier for the book to a class structure which represents a snapshot of the top 21 levels of the book state together with a record of all events having occurred since the previous state was published.  In most cases, agents will need to iterate over the books, and apply the same logic to each of them in order to execute their strategy on all realizations of the simulated market.  As demonstrated in the examples, this is most straightforwardly achieved by a simple for loop:

```python
for book_id, book in state.books.items():
    # Analyze state data and generate instructions
```

For more complex and advanced strategies, it may be necessary to parallelize the processing of books in order to ensure to generate a response within the timeout.  Details of how to achieve this are for the miner to design in a manner suitable for their implementation and hosting configuration.

Each book object contains `bids` and `asks` arrays representing the top 21 levels on either side of the order book.  The arrays are ordered with higher indices corresponding to levels further from the midquote, meaning that the best bid (highest buy offer) and best ask (lowest sell offer) are at index 0.  Each level object has a `price` and `quantity` field indicating the price level and the total quantity of all resting orders composing the level.  The topmost levels include also an `orders` field which reveals the composition of the level in terms of the individual orders existing at that price.

```python
# Topmost LevelInfo objects
best_bid_level = book.bids[0]
best_ask_level = book.bids[0]
# Best bid price and volume
bid = best_bid_level.price
bid_vol = best_bid_level.quantity
# Best bid price and volume
ask = best_ask_level.price
ask_vol = best_ask_level.quantity
# Calculate spread
spread = ask - bid
```

The book object further contains an `events` field, which is populated with a complete listing of all the events which have occurred since the last state update.  This allows to reconstruct the complete, high-frequency history of the state of the orderbook throughout the previous publishing interval.  Full details of this procedure and usage are beyond the scope of this document, but the [ImbalanceAgent](/agents/ImbalanceAgent.py) sample agent demonstrates how to use this field and the associated tools to make use of a more complete, high-resolution record of the book state evolution.  An example of a simple use of this record is to obtain the price at which the last trade occurred; the `book` class includes a property method which allows to easily retrieve the latest `TradeInfo` object in the `events` record:

```python
last_trade : TradeInfo = book.last_trade
last_trade_price = last_trade.price
```

It may also be useful for certain strategies to obtain the trade price history over the preceding publishing interval:

```python
trade_price_history = {event.timestamp : event.price for event in book.events if event.type == 't'}
```

#### Notices

The `notices` field of the state update contains a dictionary mapping UIDs to a list of notifications corresponding to events that have occurred specifically in relation to that UID's previously submitted orders.  When received by a miner, this field contains only the notices corresponding to the receiving agent's actions.  If your agent does not override the default `FinanceSimulationAgent.update` method, specific event types can be handled by defining the appropriate functions in your agent code:

- `onStart(self, event : SimulationStartEvent)` : Triggered on start of a new simulation.
- `onOrderAccepted(self, event : OrderPlacementEvent)` : Triggered when an agent's order is accepted by the simulator.
- `onOrderRejected(self, event : OrderPlacementEvent)` : Triggered when an agent's order is rejected by the simulator (due to e.g. insufficient balance, invalid parameters etc).
- `onOrderCancelled(self, event : OrderCancellationEvent)` : Triggered when an agent's order is successfully cancelled in the simulator.
- `onOrderCancellationFailed(self, event : OrderCancellationEvent)` : Triggered when an agent's order fails to be cancelled in the simulator.
- `onTrade(self, event : TradeEvent)` : Triggered when an agent's order is involved in the trade.
- `onEnd(self, event : SimulationEndEvent)` : Triggered when a simulation ends.

To specify logic to be executed when a particular type of notice is received, simply define the handler function in your agent class:

```python
class MyTradingAgent(FinanceSimulationAgent):
    def initialize(self):
        ...

    def respond(self, state : MarketSimulationStateUpdate) -> FinanceAgentResponse:
        ...

    def onTrade(self, event : TradeEvent) -> None:
        print("{event}")
        # Do something - update internal records, trigger placement of a new order, recalculate statistics etc.
```

Note of course that these notices are part of the state update, and so all events occurring in the previous interval will be processed in sequence when the state is received (i.e. before your `respond` method is called).

## Response

Once a miner has received and analyzed the data, they must make a decision about what instructions they wish to submit to the simulation.  Any trading strategy is possible to implement, but note that the state is only published once every `config.publish_interval` simulation nanoseconds, and miners are only able to submit instructions in response to the state.  This implies that strategies must all operate at >=5 second timescale (we aim to lift/reduce this limitation in future).  Some simple example agent implementations can be found in this directory; **it is not expected that running any of the example agents without modification would lead to successful mining in the subnet**.

Miners are expected to develop their own custom agent logic and compete to improve their risk-adjusted performance.  This section documents and explains the usage of the tools involved in agent logic implementation; it does not intend to provide any guidance as to how to design a successful strategy.  However, our simulated markets aim to accurately approximate real markets, so that the same considerations should be applied when formulating strategies as in any trading scenario.  There are further some important limitations and restrictions imposed on miner agents which must be considered when designing a trading strategy, these are also reviewed and explained in the following sections.

### The `FinanceAgentResponse` Class

In order to submit instructions to the validator, a miner must respond to the validator request with an instance of the [`FinanceAgentResponse` class](/taos/im/protocol/response.py).  This class contains one property, `instructions`, which holds an array of `FinanceInstruction`, defined to encapsulate the three main instruction types which miners are able to execute : `PlaceMarketOrderInstruction`, `PlaceLimitOrderInstruction` and `CancelOrdersInstruction` (defined [here](/taos/im/protocol/instructions.py)).  The class additionally exposes convenience methods which allow to easily attach these instruction types to the `FinanceAgentResponse` instance:

### Timeout

The query logic of validators enforces a timeout which specifies how long miners may take at maximum to respond to state updates.  The exact value of the timeout is subject to change, and is set in the [validator config](/taos/im/config/__init__.py) as `neuron.timeout` (see the `default` value for the current active setting).  If a response is not received within the timeout, no instructions will be submitted to the simulator for that agent.  It is the miner agent's responsibility to ensure that they receive, decompress and process the state update, as well as generate and return instructions, before the timeout expires.  This requires to allocate sufficient resources (CPU and network bandwidth) and optimize data analysis and other processes involved in trading decision making, and it will also benefit the miner to locate nearby to key validators.

---

### Latency

In real-world trading, thereâ€™s always some delay between submitting an order and it reaching the exchange. The simulator models this **latency** to make the simulation more realistic.

#### Response Time

When you submit instructions as a miner agent, theyâ€™re not executed immediately. Instead:  

- The simulator applies a **processing delay** to your instructions.  
- This delay is based on how quickly your agent responds to the validatorâ€™s state update.  
- **Faster responses mean your instructions are executed sooner** than those of slower agents.

The logic for calculating these delays is defined in the [`set_delays`](/taos/im/validator/reward.py) function.  

#### The `delay` Parameter

You can also manually add a **custom delay** to your instructions. This lets you schedule actions to happen later within the current simulation interval, rather than all at once:

```python
# Place an order immediately when the simulator receives your response
# This will be processed 0 simulation nanoseconds after the response time latency 
# determined by `set_delays` has elapsed
response.limit_order(
    book_id=0,
    direction=OrderDirection.BUY,
    quantity=1.0,
    price=301.25,
    delay=0
)

# Place another order 500ms after the instruction is received
response.limit_order(
    book_id=0,
    direction=OrderDirection.BUY,
    quantity=1.0,
    price=301.00,
    delay=500_000_000_000  # nanoseconds
)

# Place a third order 1.5 after the instruction is received
response.limit_order(
    book_id=0,
    direction=OrderDirection.BUY,
    quantity=1.0,
    price=300.75,
    delay=1_500_000_000_000
)

# Place a fourth order 3 after the instruction is received
response.limit_order(
    book_id=0,
    direction=OrderDirection.BUY,
    quantity=1.0,
    price=300.50,
    delay=3_000_000_000_000
)
```
This allows to attempt to take advantage of movements in price during the period between state updates, where otherwise miner agents are not able to participate.  The delay you specify is added on top of your agentâ€™s response time latency. To maximize your advantage, you should aim to respond quickly as well as carefully scheduling your actions to take advantage of price movements within the publishing interval.

---

### Trading Volume

Trading volume plays an important role in determining the rewards assigned to a miner agent.  The trading volume of an agent is defined as the total value in QUOTE of the quantity of orders submitted by the agent which are matched by the simulator.  For example, if a miner submits an instruction to place an order with a quantity of `2.0`, and this order is matched at price `300.00`, their trading volume is increased by `600.00`.  This is true regardless of the role of the agent's order in the trade as either maker or taker.

#### Contribution to Reward

The primary component of incentive mechanism of the subnet is the risk-adjusted performance of the strategy, which is calculated using an intra-day Sharpe ratio where the returns are obtained as the difference in total inventory value held by the agent between subsequent state updates (see [rewarding logic](/taos/im/validator/reward.py)).  

In order to avoid rewarding miners who do not participate in active trading, as well as to incentivize the creation of volume in the simulated market, the calculated Sharpe values are then scaled by a factor derived using the agent's total traded volume over a [configured period](/taos/im/config/__init__.py) (see `scoring.activity.trade_volume_assessment_period`) of simulation time.  It should further be noted that, although any amount of traded volume within each `scoring.activity.trade_volume_sampling_interval` will trigger the volume factor to be assigned a value based on the traded volume during the assessment period, if no trades occur in the previous sampling interval then the volume factor will start to decay.  This is designed to prevent miners from producing a burst of trading activity once within the assessment period, and then stopping trading activity to benefit from the volume factor without maintaining consistent active trading. 

The inclusion of this factor in the scoring has the effect of magnifying the Sharpe ratios for miners which have executed more volume during the assessment period.  If the agent achieves a good Sharpe ratio while also trading significant volume, they will be rewarded more highly than a miner with the same performance at a lower traded volume.  Similarly, if a miner has high volume and poor Sharpe ratio, they will receive a worse score than a miner with the same performance and lower volume.  This discourages maximization of volume without sufficient regard for the performance, while also incentivizing the deployment of strategies which are both optimally risk-managed and highly active.

#### Trading Limitation

The validator logic also implements a cap on the maximum amount that can be traded within the assessment window.  This is intended to limit attempts to attain high volume-weighted scores during periods of good performance by recklessly trading purely for the sake of volume creation.  The limit is configured as a multiplier on the value of the initial capital allocated to miner agents; the multiplier is configured by validators using the `scoring.activity.capital_turnover_cap` parameter, where the value of initial capital allocated is configured in the simulator and can be read from the state update `config` field `miner_wealth`.  

Explicitly, if a miner has traded more than `scoring.activity.capital_turnover_cap * state.config.miner_wealth` in volume on a particular book over the `scoring.activity.trade_volume_assessment_period`, they will not be able to submit any more instructions to that book (other than cancellations) until their total volume over the preceding assessment period drops below this limit.

## Agent Testing

### Local

You can debug and test your agent logic offline before deploying to testnet or mainnet by making use of the facilities documented [here](/agents/proxy/README.md).  This setup allows to launch the simulator on your machine, and receive messages to the agent via a proxy which fulfils the role of the validator in a local setting.

### Testnet (Netuid 366)

Once you are satisfied that your agent logic works as intended, we recommend to register a UID on testnet (netuid 366) and deploy your miner as you intend to host it in mainnet environment.  This allows to confirm that all is properly configured for communication with validators, and the resources allocated to the miner are sufficient.  You can request testnet TAO at the [Bittensor Discord](https://discord.com/channels/799672011265015819/1389370202327748629).

### Mainnet (Netuid 79)

If all looks to be functioning well in testnet, register a UID on mainnet netuid 79 and restart your miner using the mainnet endpoint and your registered hotkey.  If you encounter issues, our team monitors the [Ï„aos channel](https://discord.com/channels/799672011265015819/1353733356470276096) at BT Discord server.

Good luck!
